#HyperNEAT in Go

A fork of a HyperNEAT implementation (find the original source [here](https://github.com/boggo/neat).)

Currently, the main purpose of this is to understand this HyperNEAT implementation and hopefully expand upon it if possible.

##Usage

This program has the dependencies [neural](https://github.com/boggo/neural) and [random](https://github.com/boggo/random), both also repositories by boggo. Make sure that you have these in the right directories before running experiments.

To run an experiment, go to the experiments folder and simply use `go run EXPERIMENT_NAME.go`
